For task 3 in the assignment, all the reads are expected to align with the reference. This is expected as we are penalizing
the inexact matchings in terms of a cost value. Therefore the total number of alignments in both forward and reverse strands is ;
218

 The distribution of the alignments are as follows : 
no_of_alignments	read_count_with_no
1					152
2					55
3					27
4					39
5					24
6					31
7					23
8					22
9					18
10					12
11					11
12					5
13					7
14					2
17					2
18					1
19					2
21					1
22					1
26					1

 The distribution of costs is as follows :
cost read_count_with_cost
0.0					211:0%
1.0					222:69%
2.0					3:25%
Additionally, the statistics(weighted by the number of alignments between a read and the reference) of the alignment costs are as below:
Highest observed cost = 2.0
Median = 1.0
Mean = 0.522935779817

 It is also noteworthy that in some cases, a large number of alignments are reported with indel operations spanning a significant length
of the reference. In this case, we need to control the output space by introducing a gap penalty (for gap initiation and continuation).
