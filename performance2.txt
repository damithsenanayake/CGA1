For task 2 in the assignment, the number of reads that was considered is ;
109
Out of them, the number of reads that have concordant alignments: 
	 81

 The distribution of number of concordant alignments is as follows : 
no_of_alignments	read_count_with_no
0					28:25%
1					47:43%
2					20:18%
3					5:4%
4					6:5%
5					1:0%
9					1:0%
18					1:0%

It is notable that the number of read pairs with no alignments is 28 as it was 59 for exact alignment of the
previous case. However, considering that this is only half the number of considerations (since a pair is considered
as one), it may be noted that the number of non aligning cases may be about the same. However, the amount of alignments
in a single pair seems to have increased, since this it means that there are multiple alignments possible for a given
pair of reads combinatorially.Therefore, large numbers of alignments such as 18 and 9 can be seen.

To further improve the specificity, we could also consider the concordance in terms of the distance between a pair of
reads. This has not  been considered in this calculation.
