For task 1 in the assignment, the number of reads that exactly align with the reference is ;
218
Out of them, the number of reads that align with the forward strand is:
	 134
 The number of reads that align with the reverse strand is :
	74

 The distribution of the alignments are as follows :
no_of_alignments	read_count_with_no
0					59:27%
1					138:63%
2					41:18%
3					14:6%
4					12:5%
5					3:1%

For task 2 in the assignment, the number of reads that was considered is ;
109
Out of them, the number of reads that have concordant alignments:
	 81

 The distribution of number of concordant alignments is as follows :
no_of_alignments	read_count_with_no
0					28:25%
1					47:43%
2					20:18%
3					5:4%
4					6:5%
5					1:0%
9					1:0%
18					1:0%

It is notable that the number of read pairs with no alignments is 28 as it was 59 for exact alignment of the
previous case. However, considering that this is only half the number of considerations (since a pair is considered
as one), it may be noted that the number of non aligning cases may be about the same. However, the amount of alignments
in a single pair seems to have increased, since this it means that there are multiple alignments possible for a given
pair of reads combinatorially.Therefore, large numbers of alignments such as 18 and 9 can be seen.

To further improve the specificity, we could also consider the concordance in terms of the distance between a pair of
reads. This has not  been considered in this calculation.

For task 3 in the assignment, all the reads are expected to align with the reference. This is expected as we are penalizing
the inexact matchings in terms of a cost value. Therefore the total number of alignments in both forward and reverse strands is ;
218

 The distribution of the alignments are as follows :
no_of_alignments	read_count_with_no
1					152
2					55
3					27
4					39
5					24
6					31
7					23
8					22
9					18
10					12
11					11
12					5
13					7
14					2
17					2
18					1
19					2
21					1
22					1
26					1

 The distribution of costs is as follows :
cost read_count_with_cost
0.0					211:0%
1.0					222:69%
2.0					3:25%
Additionally, the statistics(weighted by the number of alignments between a read and the reference) of the alignment costs are as below:
Highest observed cost = 2.0
Median = 1.0
Mean = 0.522935779817

 It is also noteworthy that in some cases, a large number of alignments are reported with indel operations spanning a significant length
of the reference. In this case, we need to control the output space by introducing a gap penalty (for gap initiation and continuation).
